## Description
Can you find the flag on this website.
Try to find the flag [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:64986/).
## Hint
SQLiLite
## Solution
- The website has a login page with fields for username and password.
- Entering random data and submitting the form showed this message
```
username: sfa
password: asfdaf
SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = 'asfdaf' AND username = 'sfa'
```
- This message shows that the website is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- opened burpsuite and intercepted the request and sent it to the repeater.
- saw this text in the HTTP header: `username=wds&password=sdfa`
- Modified the request to `username=wds&password=' OR '1'='1'--` and sent it.
- Got the flag in the response: `picoCTF{G3tting_5QL_1nJ3c7I0N_l1k3_y0u_sh0ulD_78d0583a}`
