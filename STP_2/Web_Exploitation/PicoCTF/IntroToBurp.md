# IntroToBurp
`Hint 1: Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.`  
`Hint 2: Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.`
- I didn't have any idea what burpsuite was, so I searched it up and found out that it was a tool used for web application security testing. I downloaded the tool from their [site](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-9-4).
- I was chatting with an LLM to work on how to proceed with this challenge.
- Went to the site and saw a Registration page.
- I filled the form fields with random data and clicked on the Register button.
- I saw there's a 2fa authentication page which asked for an OTP.
- I entered a random OTP and clicked on the Submit button.
- I saw a message saying "Invalid OTP".
- Reopened the website.
- Opened burpsuite and started a temporary project in memory using Burp defaults.
- went to the Proxy tab and clicked on open browser.
- copied the URL of the chall site and pasted it in the browser.
- turned on Intercept, filled the form fields with random data and clicked on the Register button.
- clicked on the Forward button in burpsuite.
- entered a random OTP and clicked on the Submit button.
- This was what I saw in the request:

- I saw that the OTP was sent in the request.
- I removed the OTP parameter from the request and clicked on the Forward button.
- I saw the following text on the page: `Welcome, fasfs you sucessfully bypassed the OTP request. Your Flag: picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_e1eb16ed}`
