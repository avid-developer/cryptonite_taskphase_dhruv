## Solution
- The given link is a website with the text `Enter flag:` and a text box to enter the flag with a submit button.
- Entering a random flag and clicking submit gives the message `Incorrect!`.
- Decided to inspect the page and found the following code:
```html
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<script src="G82XCw5CX3.js"></script>
</head>
<body data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded="14.1205.0" data-gr-ext-installed="" data-new-gr-c-s-loaded="14.1206.0">
	<h4>Enter flag:</h4>
	<input type="text" id="input">
	<button onclick="onButtonPress()">Submit</button>
	<p id="result">Incorrect!</p>
...
```
- the script `G82XCw5CX3.js` contains obfuscated code.
- decided to go to Sources tab in the developer tools to look for other files.
- found a wasm file `62e5ae56` in the `wasm` folder.
- the flag was in plaintext at the end of the wasm file: `picoCTF{cb688c00b5a2ede7eaedcae883735759}`
