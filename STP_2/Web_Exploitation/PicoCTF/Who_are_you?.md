Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/
## Hint
It ain't much, but it's an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616
## Solution
- website had the text `Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!`
- went to the Network Conditions section of the developer tools and changed the User Agent to `PicoBrowser` and refreshed the page
- Was greeted with the text `I don't trust users visiting from another site.`
- I was a bit lost as to what to do now so i started looking for solutions online
- went through a few writeups and the chall is quite interesting
- it's all about modifying the HTTP headers so I decided to use burpsuite to intercept the request and send it to repeater
- First, I changed the User Agent to `PicoBrowser` and sent the request
- Then got the text `I don't trust users visiting from another site.`
- I then added the `Referer` header to `mercury.picoctf.net:34588` and sent the request
- Got the text `Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.`
- I then added the `Date` header to `2018` and sent the request
- Got the text `I don't trust users who can be tracked.`
- I then added the `DNT` header to `1` and sent the request
- Got the text `This website is only for people from Sweden.`
- I then added the `X-Forwarded-For` header to `102.177.146.0` (a random Swedish IP address i googled) and sent the request
- Got the text `You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?`
- I then modified the `Accept-Language` header to `sv` from `en-GB,en;q=0.9` and sent the request
- Got the flag `picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_79e451a7}`
