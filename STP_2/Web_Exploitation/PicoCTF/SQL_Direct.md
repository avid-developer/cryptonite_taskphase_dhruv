# SQL Direct
## Description
```
Connect to this PostgreSQL server and find the flag!
psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 57799 -U postgres pico
Password is postgres
```
## Hint
What does a SQL database contain?
## Solution
- Installed PostgreSQL
- Connected to the server using the given command and password
- This is my first time using PostgreSQL, so I typed `help` to see the available commands and got this message:
```
You are using psql, the command-line interface to PostgreSQL.
Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help with psql commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit
```
- I typed `\?` to see the available psql commands and found this in the `Informational` section
```
Informational
  (options: S = show system objects, + = additional detail)
  \d[S+]                 list tables, views, and sequences
```
- I typed `\d` to list the tables and found this
```
         List of relations
 Schema | Name  | Type  |  Owner   
--------+-------+-------+----------
 public | flags | table | postgres
(1 row)
```
- I typed `select * from flags;` to see the contents of the table and got the flag
```
 id | firstname | lastname  |                address                 
----+-----------+-----------+----------------------------------------
  1 | Luke      | Skywalker | picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_73b0678f}
  2 | Leia      | Organa    | Alderaan
  3 | Han       | Solo      | Corellia
